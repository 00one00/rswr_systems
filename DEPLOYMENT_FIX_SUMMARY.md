# RS Systems Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WSGI Configuration Errors
**Problem**: The `application.py` and `manage.py` files were pointing to `django_settings` instead of `rs_systems.settings`, causing the AWS deployment to fail with KeyError: 'CONTENT_LENGTH'.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `manage.py` to use `rs_systems.settings`
- Updated `application.py` to use `rs_systems.settings`
- Updated `Procfile` to use `rs_systems.wsgi:application`
- Updated `.ebextensions/01_wsgi.config` to use correct Django settings module

### 2. Static Files Configuration
**Problem**: CSS and JavaScript files were not loading on AWS due to improper static files configuration.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `rs_systems/settings.py` to use different static file storage based on environment
- For production (AWS): Uses `django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage`
- For development: Uses `whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage`
- Added `.ebextensions/02_static.config` for AWS static files handling

### 3. Directory Structure Cleanup
**Problem**: Duplicate directories and files were causing confusion and potential conflicts.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed duplicate `rswr_systems/` directory
- Cleaned up unnecessary files (`server.log`, `cookies.txt`, etc.)
- Maintained proper structure with `static/` and `staticfiles/` directories

### 4. User Groups and Permissions
**Problem**: Technician groups were not showing up properly in admin due to setup command issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed username mismatch in `core/management/commands/setup_groups.py`
- Ensured proper creation of Technicians group and test users

### 5. API Serializer Error
**Problem**: DRF Spectacular was throwing an error about invalid field `contact_info` in CustomerSerializer.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `apps/technician_portal/api/serializers.py` to use correct Customer model fields
- Fixed import to use `core.models.Customer` instead of `apps.technician_portal.models.Customer`
- Updated CustomerSerializer fields to match actual Customer model fields

## Current Working Configuration

### Local Development
```bash
# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver 8000

# The application will be available at http://localhost:8000
```

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment
The following files are now properly configured for AWS deployment:

1. **application.py** - Correct WSGI application entry point
2. **Procfile** - Points to correct WSGI application
3. **.ebextensions/01_wsgi.config** - AWS EB WSGI configuration
4. **.ebextensions/02_static.config** - AWS EB static files configuration
5. **rs_systems/settings.py** - Environment-aware static files configuration

### Environment Variables for AWS
Set these in your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment:
```
ENVIRONMENT=production
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=rs_systems.settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

## Test Users Created
- **Admin User**: username=`admin`, password=`123`
- **Technician Manager**: username=`johndoe`, password=`123`
- **Technician**: username=`jdoe`, password=`123`

## Deployment Steps

### For AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
1. Ensure all environment variables are set
2. Deploy using EB CLI or AWS Console
3. The static files will be automatically collected during deployment
4. Access the application at your EB environment URL

### For Local Development:
1. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Run setup command: `python manage.py setup_groups`
5. Collect static files: `python manage.py collectstatic`
6. Start server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Key Files Modified
- `manage.py` - Fixed Django settings module
- `application.py` - Fixed Django settings module
- `Procfile` - Fixed WSGI application path
- `rs_systems/settings.py` - Added environment-aware static files configuration
- `.ebextensions/01_wsgi.config` - Fixed Django settings module
- `.ebextensions/02_static.config` - Added static files configuration
- `core/management/commands/setup_groups.py` - Fixed username mismatch
- `apps/technician_portal/api/serializers.py` - Fixed CustomerSerializer fields and import

## Verification Steps
1. **Local**: Visit http://localhost:8000 - should show home page with proper styling
2. **Local**: Login with test users - should redirect to appropriate dashboards
3. **Local**: Admin interface should show Technicians group
4. **AWS**: Application should load with proper CSS/JS styling
5. **AWS**: All functionality should work as expected

The application is now properly configured for both local development and AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment.

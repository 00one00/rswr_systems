## System Architecture

The Referral and Rewards System is built as a Django application within the larger RS Systems platform. It consists of several key components:

- **Models**: Define the database structure for referral codes, referrals, rewards, and redemptions
- **Services**: Contain business logic for referral processing, reward management, and fulfillment
- **Views**: Handle HTTP requests and responses for various user interfaces
- **URLs**: Define routing for the application's endpoints
- **Templates**: Provide the user interface for customers and technicians

The system follows a service-oriented architecture within the Django framework, with clear separation of concerns between data models, business logic, and presentation layers.

## Core Components

### 1. Referral Management

- **Referral Code Generation**: Customers can generate unique referral codes to share with others
- **Referral Tracking**: The system tracks when new customers sign up using a referral code
- **Referral Statistics**: Customers can view statistics about their referrals, including total count and points earned

### 2. Reward Management

- **Point Accumulation**: Customers earn points for successful referrals and other actions
- **Reward Options**: Various rewards are available for redemption, with different point requirements
- **Redemption Processing**: Customers can redeem points for rewards, which then go through an approval and fulfillment workflow

### 3. Fulfillment System

- **Technician Assignment**: Eligible technicians are assigned to fulfill reward redemptions
- **Notification System**: Technicians are notified of new redemptions that require their attention
- **Fulfillment Tracking**: The system tracks the status of each redemption from request to completion

## Database Structure

The system uses the following key models:

### ReferralCode
- Stores unique referral codes linked to customer users
- Fields: `code`, `customer_user`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Referral
- Tracks successful referrals when new customers use a referral code
- Fields: `referral_code`, `customer_user`, `created_at`

### RewardType
- Defines types of rewards and how they should be applied
- Fields: `name`, `category`, `discount_type`, `discount_value`, `description`, `is_active`
- Categories include: repair discounts, replacement discounts, free services, merchandise, gift cards, etc.
- Discount types include: percentage, fixed amount, free (100% off), or none

### Reward
- Tracks point balances for customers
- Fields: `customer_user`, `points`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### RewardOption
- Defines available redemption options
- Fields: `name`, `description`, `points_required`, `reward_type`, `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### RewardRedemption
- Tracks redemption requests and their fulfillment status
- Fields: `reward`, `reward_option`, `created_at`, `status`, `notes`, `processed_by`, `processed_at`, `assigned_technician`, `fulfilled_at`, `applied_to_repair`
- Status options: pending, approved, fulfilled, rejected

## User Workflows

### Customer Workflow

1. **Referral Generation**:
   - Customer logs into their account
   - Navigates to the referrals section
   - Generates a unique referral code
   - Shares the code with friends, family, or colleagues

2. **Earning Points**:
   - New customers sign up using the referral code
   - When a new customer uses the code, both the referrer and the new customer receive points
   - Referrer receives 500 points per successful referral
   - New customer receives 100 points as a welcome bonus

3. **Reward Redemption**:
   - Customer views available rewards based on their point balance
   - Selects a reward to redeem
   - Confirms redemption, points are deducted from their balance
   - Receives confirmation and tracking information for their redemption

4. **Redemption Tracking**:
   - Customer can view their redemption history
   - Sees status updates as their redemption moves through the fulfillment process
   - Receives notification when their redemption is fulfilled

### Technician Workflow

1. **Redemption Assignment**:
   - System assigns redemptions to technicians based on workload and availability
   - Technician receives notification of new assignment

2. **Fulfillment Process**:
   - Technician reviews the redemption details
   - Processes the reward (applies discount, provides service, etc.)
   - Marks the redemption as fulfilled
   - Adds notes about the fulfillment process if needed

3. **Reward Application**:
   - For repair-related rewards, technicians can apply the reward directly to a repair
   - The system links the redemption to the specific repair record

## Technical Implementation

### Service Classes

The system implements three main service classes to encapsulate business logic:

#### ReferralService
- Handles generation of referral codes
- Validates and processes referrals
- Tracks referral statistics

```python
class ReferralService:
    @staticmethod
    def generate_referral_code(customer_user):
        # Generate unique code
        
    @staticmethod
    def process_referral(referral_code_obj, customer_user):
        # Process referral and award points
```

#### RewardService
- Manages reward points and balances
- Handles redemption requests
- Provides available reward options based on point balance

```python
class RewardService:
    @staticmethod
    def get_reward_balance(customer_user):
        # Get current point balance
        
    @staticmethod
    def redeem_reward(customer_user, reward_option_id):
        # Process redemption and deduct points
```

#### RewardFulfillmentService
- Assigns technicians to fulfill redemptions
- Manages the redemption fulfillment process
- Handles notifications between customers and technicians

```python
class RewardFulfillmentService:
    @staticmethod
    def assign_technician(redemption):
        # Find and assign appropriate technician
        
    @staticmethod
    def mark_as_fulfilled(redemption, technician, notes=None):
        # Mark redemption as complete
```

### API Endpoints

The system provides the following key endpoints:

- `/generate-referral-code/`: Generate a new referral code
- `/referral-code/`: Get the current user's referral code
- `/referral-tracking/`: Track a successful referral
- `/referral-history/`: View referral history
- `/referral-stats/`: Get statistics about referrals
- `/referral-leaderboard/`: View top referrers
- `/reward-balance/`: Check current reward balance
- `/reward-options/`: View available reward options
- `/redeem-reward/`: Redeem points for a reward
- `/referral-rewards/`: Main dashboard for rewards system
- `/referral-rewards-history/`: View redemption history

## Interaction with Other Systems

The Referral and Rewards System interacts with the following components:

### Customer Portal
- Allows customers to access the referral and rewards dashboard
- Provides interfaces for generating codes, tracking referrals, and redeeming rewards

### Technician Portal
- Notifies technicians of new redemptions to fulfill
- Allows technicians to process and complete redemptions

### Repair System
- Enables rewards to be applied directly to repairs
- Links redemptions to specific repair records for tracking

## Security Considerations

The system implements several security measures:

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require login authentication
2. **Authorization**: Customers can only access their own referral codes and redemptions
3. **Validation**: Referral codes are validated before processing
4. **Anti-fraud Measures**:
   - Users cannot refer themselves
   - Each referral code can only be used once per customer
   - Points are only awarded for genuine referrals

## Potential Improvements

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Enhanced Analytics**: Add more detailed analytics about referral performance
2. **Multi-channel Sharing**: Integrate social media sharing for referral codes
3. **Reward Categorization**: Implement better categorization and filtering of reward options
4. **Email Notifications**: Add email notifications for important events in the referral/reward process

### Mid-term Improvements
1. **Dynamic Point System**: Implement variable point values based on customer value or promotional periods
2. **A/B Testing Framework**: Test different referral incentives and reward structures
3. **Personalized Rewards**: Offer rewards tailored to customer preferences and history
4. **Mobile App Integration**: Deeper integration with mobile apps for better user experience

### Long-term Vision
1. **Partner Network**: Expand rewards to include partner businesses and services
2. **Tiered Reward System**: Implement levels or tiers in the rewards program to encourage loyalty
3. **Gamification Elements**: Add badges, achievements, and challenges to increase engagement
4. **AI-driven Recommendations**: Use machine learning to suggest optimal referral strategies and reward options
5. **Blockchain-based Point System**: Explore using blockchain for transparent and secure point tracking

## Performance Testing

### Database Query Performance

```python
# Check for N+1 queries
from django.test.utils import override_settings
from django.db import connection
from django.test import TestCase

with override_settings(DEBUG=True):
    connection.queries_log.clear()
    # Perform action
    repairs = Repair.objects.all()[:10]
    for repair in repairs:
        customer_name = repair.customer.name

    # Check query count
    query_count = len(connection.queries)
    print(f"Queries executed: {query_count}")
    # Should be ~2 (1 for repairs, 1 for customers with select_related)
```

### Page Load Testing

```bash
# Test page load times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s https://[domain]/app/

# curl-format.txt:
# time_namelookup:  %{time_namelookup}\n
# time_connect:  %{time_connect}\n
# time_starttransfer:  %{time_starttransfer}\n
# time_total:  %{time_total}\n

# Expected:
# < 1s for static pages
# < 3s for dashboard pages with data
```

### Load Testing (Production)

```bash
# Use Apache Bench for basic load testing
ab -n 1000 -c 10 https://[domain]/

# -n 1000: Total requests
# -c 10: Concurrent requests

# Expected:
# Requests per second: >50
# Time per request: <200ms average
# Failed requests: 0
```

## Testing Best Practices

### Before Deployment

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests passing (`python manage.py test`)
- [ ] Django system check clean (`python manage.py check --deploy`)
- [ ] Security audit clean (`python manage.py security_audit`)
- [ ] Manual testing of new features complete
- [ ] Regression testing of existing features
- [ ] Performance testing acceptable
- [ ] Database migrations tested on development database

### Test Data Management

**Creating Test Data:**
```bash
# Create fresh test data
python manage.py create_test_data --clean

# Creates:
# - 3 customers (abc logistics, city delivery, eos trucking)
# - 3 technicians (tech1, tech2, tech3)
# - Various repairs in different statuses
# - Sample pricing configurations
```

**Cleaning Test Data:**
```python
# Remove test data (use carefully!)
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Remove test users
User.objects.filter(username__startswith='test').delete()

# Remove test customers
Customer.objects.filter(name__icontains='test').delete()
```

### Continuous Integration

**GitHub Actions Example:**
```yaml
name: Django Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python manage.py test
          python manage.py check --deploy
```

- **Views**: ~70% covered
- **Business Logic**: ~90% covered
- **Templates**: Manual testing only
- **API**: ~85% covered

### Generating Coverage Report

```bash
# Install coverage
pip install coverage

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test

# Generate report
coverage report

# HTML report
coverage html
# Open htmlcov/index.html
```

---

## Debugging Failed Tests

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Database Integrity Errors**
```python
# Clear test database
python manage.py flush --no-input

# Or use fresh migrations
python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
```

**Issue 2: Import Errors**
```python
# Check Python path
import sys
print(sys.path)

# Ensure project root is in path
```

**Issue 3: Permissions Errors**
```python
# Ensure test user has correct permissions
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission

# Add user to group
tech_group = Group.objects.get(name='Technicians')
user.groups.add(tech_group)
```

### Verbose Test Output

```bash
# Run with maximum verbosity
python manage.py test --verbosity=3

# Keep test database
python manage.py test --keepdb

# Run specific test
python manage.py test apps.technician_portal.tests.TestRepairModel.test_pricing
```

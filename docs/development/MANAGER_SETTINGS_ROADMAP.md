## 🚧 Phase 2: Pricing Management (Planned)

### Overview
Extend manager settings to include comprehensive pricing configuration capabilities, reducing dependency on database-level pricing modifications.

### Planned Features

**Purpose**: Configure base pricing structure for repair count tiers

**Proposed Features**:
- **Tier Management**: Create, edit, delete pricing tiers
- **Tier Configuration**:
  - Repair count range (e.g., 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, 11+)
  - Base price for tier
  - Description/rationale
  - Active/inactive status
- **Tier Preview**: Visual chart showing pricing progression
- **Default Tier**: Mark one tier as system default

**UI Pattern**: Similar card-based interface with modal editing

#### Per-Customer Pricing Rules (`/tech/settings/pricing/customers/`)
**Purpose**: Override default pricing for specific customers

**Proposed Features**:
- **Customer Selection**: Dropdown or search for customer
- **Pricing Overrides**:
  - Custom tier structure for customer
  - Flat rate option
  - Percentage discount across all tiers
  - Fixed discount per repair
- **Effective Date Range**: Start/end dates for pricing rules
- **Notes Field**: Document pricing agreement rationale

**Business Logic**:
- Customer-specific rules override global tiers
- Multiple rules per customer with date-based priority
- Audit trail for all pricing changes

#### Volume Discount Management (`/tech/settings/pricing/discounts/`)
**Purpose**: Configure automatic discounts based on repair volume

**Proposed Features**:
- **Discount Rules**:
  - Minimum repair count threshold
  - Discount type (percentage or fixed amount)
  - Discount value
  - Duration (per month, per quarter, lifetime)
- **Customer Eligibility**: Apply to all or specific customers
- **Stacking Rules**: Define if discounts can stack with customer pricing

**Technical Considerations**:
- Integration with existing `calculate_repair_cost()` logic
- Backward compatibility with current pricing system
- Database migration for new models

#### Pricing Override Approval Workflow (`/tech/settings/pricing/overrides/`)
**Purpose**: Manage and approve pricing overrides requested by technicians

**Proposed Features**:
- **Pending Overrides Queue**: List of overrides awaiting approval
- **Override Details**:
  - Repair information
  - Technician requesting override
  - Original calculated price
  - Requested price
  - Justification/reason
- **Approval Actions**:
  - Approve with note
  - Deny with reason
  - Request more information
- **Approval Limits**: Respect manager's `approval_limit` field
- **Escalation**: Auto-escalate overrides exceeding limit to higher authority

**Integration**:
- Extends existing repair cost override functionality
- Adds approval workflow layer
- Email/notification triggers for pending approvals

### Database Models (Proposed)

```python

3. **Pricing Audit Log** - Compliance requirement

### Medium Priority (2-3 Quarters)
1. **Customer-Specific Pricing** - Business growth enabler
2. **Volume Discounts** - Competitive advantage
3. **Team Performance Reports** - Management insights

### Low Priority (Future)
1. **Advanced Analytics** - Nice-to-have
2. **Team Scheduling** - Process improvement
3. **Integration Settings** - Scalability feature

---

## Technical Considerations

### Backward Compatibility
- All new features must maintain existing pricing calculation logic
- Database migrations must not break current workflows
- API changes must be versioned

### Performance
- Large audit logs require pagination and indexing
- Reporting features need caching layer
- AJAX operations must remain under 200ms response time

### Security
- All manager actions must be authenticated and authorized
- Audit logs must be append-only (no deletion)
- Sensitive pricing data needs encryption at rest

### Testing
- Unit tests for all pricing calculation changes
- Integration tests for approval workflows
- UI tests for manager settings interfaces

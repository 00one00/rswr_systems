# Workflow Implementation Phases - Complete Feature Coverage

## 📋 Overview
This document breaks down ALL features from PRACTICAL_WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md into manageable implementation phases. Each phase is designed to be completed without context overflow, with clear dependencies and testing requirements.

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES - October 2025
**Manager Assignment & Customer Approval System** - COMPLETED & VERIFIED

### Security & Workflow Fixes Implemented
- [x] ✅ **SECURITY FIX**: Technicians can no longer bypass customer approval by setting repair status to COMPLETED
  - Previously: Technicians could set any status when creating repairs, bypassing approval requirements
  - Now: System FORCES approval check for ALL technician-created repairs regardless of status selected
  - Location: `apps/technician_portal/views.py` create_repair view

- [x] ✅ **Manager Assignment Workflow**: Full implementation of work assignment system
  - Managers can assign REQUESTED repairs to technicians on their team
  - Assignment auto-approves repair (customer already requested it)
  - Assigned technician receives notification with direct link to repair

- [x] ✅ **Customer Approval Dashboard**: Prominent alert system for pending repairs
  - Yellow alert banner when repairs need approval
  - Quick approve/deny buttons directly on dashboard
  - Shows technician, unit, damage type, cost estimate
  - Confirmation dialog for deny action

- [x] ✅ **Customer Repair Preferences**: Configurable auto-approval settings
  - AUTO_APPROVE: All field repairs auto-approved
  - REQUIRE_APPROVAL: Customer must approve every field repair
  - UNIT_THRESHOLD: Auto-approve up to X units per visit
  - Enforced server-side on ALL repair creation attempts

- [x] ✅ **Repair Status Separation**: Clear distinction between workflows
  - REQUESTED = Customer requested → Manager assigns → Auto-approved
  - PENDING = Tech found in field → Customer approves → Becomes APPROVED
  - Non-managers CANNOT see REQUESTED repairs (manager-only)
  - ALL technicians CANNOT see PENDING repairs (customer approval only)

- [x] ✅ **Notification System**: Assignment notifications with repair links
  - Added `repair` field to TechnicianNotification model
  - Notifications show "View Repair" button linking directly to assigned work
  - Also works for reward redemptions (existing functionality)

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **IntegrityError on Repair Update** (technician_id NULL)
   - Fixed: View now preserves existing technician when non-admin updates repair
   - Location: `apps/technician_portal/views.py:381-386`

2. **Approval Bypass Vulnerability** (CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE)
   - Fixed: Server-side enforcement of customer preferences regardless of status
   - Prevents technicians from circumventing approval by selecting COMPLETED status
   - Location: `apps/technician_portal/views.py:313-333`

3. **Missing Notification Links**
   - Fixed: Notifications now include direct links to assigned repairs
   - Migration: Added `repair` ForeignKey to TechnicianNotification
   - Template updated to show "View Repair" button

### Files Modified
- `apps/technician_portal/models.py` - Added repair field to TechnicianNotification
- `apps/technician_portal/views.py` - Security fix for approval bypass, assignment notifications
- `apps/customer_portal/admin.py` - Added CustomerRepairPreference admin interface
- `templates/customer_portal/dashboard.html` - Prominent PENDING repairs alert section
- `templates/technician_portal/dashboard.html` - Notification repair links
- `templates/technician_portal/repair_detail.html` - Removed approve/deny for REQUESTED
- `templates/technician_portal/repair_form.html` - Hide labels for hidden fields
- `apps/technician_portal/admin.py` - Fixed managed_technicians field display

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Create field repair as tech with customer set to "Require Approval" - stays PENDING
- [x] Create field repair trying to set status to COMPLETED - forced to PENDING
- [x] Manager assigns REQUESTED repair - tech gets notification with link
- [x] Customer sees PENDING repairs on dashboard with approve/deny buttons
- [x] Update repair as assigned technician - works without IntegrityError
- [x] Non-manager technicians cannot see REQUESTED repairs
- [x] All technicians cannot see PENDING repairs

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy
- **Small, focused changes**: Each phase modifies 2-3 files maximum
- **Incremental testing**: Test after each phase before proceeding
- **Context preservation**: Key information repeated in each phase
- **Progress tracking**: ✅ checkboxes for completed items
- **Rollback capability**: Each phase can be reverted independently

## 🔀 Git Branch Management

### Current Working Branch
**Branch**: `workflow-implementation`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Purpose**: Isolated environment for implementing all workflow phases without affecting main branch

### Branch Commands

#### Check Current Branch
```bash
git branch  # Shows all local branches with * on current
git status  # Shows current branch and any uncommitted changes
```

#### Switch Between Branches
```bash
# Switch back to main (safe) branch
git checkout main

# Return to implementation branch
git checkout workflow-implementation
```

#### Save Your Work
```bash
# Commit changes to current branch
git add .
git commit -m "Phase X.X: Description of changes"

# Push branch to GitHub (first time)
git push -u origin workflow-implementation

# Push subsequent commits
git push
```

### If Something Breaks

#### Option 1: Undo Last Changes (not committed yet)
```bash
# Discard all uncommitted changes
git reset --hard

# Or discard changes to specific file
git checkout -- path/to/file.py
```

#### Option 2: Revert to Previous Commit
```bash
# See commit history
git log --oneline -10

# Reset to specific commit (loses changes after that commit)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

#### Option 3: Start Fresh
```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Delete the branch locally
git branch -D workflow-implementation

# Create new clean branch
git checkout -b workflow-implementation
```

### Merging Back to Main

#### When Ready to Merge
```bash
# First, ensure all changes are committed
git status

# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin main

# Merge your implementation
git merge workflow-implementation

# Push merged changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```

#### Alternative: Create Pull Request
```bash
# Push your branch to GitHub
git push -u origin workflow-implementation

# Then on GitHub:
# 1. Go to your repository
# 2. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
# 3. Set base: main, compare: workflow-implementation
# 4. Review changes and create PR
```

### Emergency Backup
If you want extra safety before major changes:
```bash
# Create full backup of current state
cp -r ../rs_systems_branch2 ../rs_systems_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Or create a backup branch
git checkout -b backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git checkout workflow-implementation
```

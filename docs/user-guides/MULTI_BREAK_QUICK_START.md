### Step 3: Review Your Breaks

After saving, each break appears as a card showing:

- Break number (1, 2, 3...)
- Damage type
- Photo thumbnails
- Notes
- **Photo status warnings** (if missing):
  - ⚠️ "Missing both photos" (orange badge)
  - ⚠️ "Missing before photo" (orange badge)
  - ⚠️ "Missing after photo" (orange badge)
- **Technical details** (if provided):
  - ✓ Pre-drilled indicator
  - 🌡️ Windshield temperature
  - 💧 Resin viscosity
  - 💲 Manager override (if applicable)

You can:
- ✏️ **Edit** any break (click Edit button) to add photos or update details
- 🗑️ **Delete** a break if added by mistake

💡 **Tip**: Orange warning badges are reminders, not blockers. You can still submit without photos and add them later.

### Step 4: Review Pricing

The pricing preview shows:

```
Customer: Acme Corp [Custom Pricing]
Unit 1001: 3 breaks | $50.00 - $35.00

Break 1: $50.00 (Repair #1)
Break 2: $40.00 (Repair #2)
Break 3: $35.00 (Repair #3)

Total: $125.00
```

**How Pricing Works:**
- Each break increments the repair count for pricing
- Break 1 = priced as next repair for this unit
- Break 2 = priced as following repair
- Custom pricing (if enabled) applies automatically

---

### Step 5: Submit

Click **"Submit All Repairs (3)"** when ready.

✅ **What Happens:**
- All repairs created together (atomic transaction)
- Each break becomes a separate repair record
- All linked with same batch ID
- Customer sees them grouped for approval
- You're redirected to repair list filtered by this customer

---

## Important Notes

### Progressive Pricing

Each break in your batch counts as a separate repair for pricing:

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Unit has 0 repairs | Break 1: $50, Break 2: $40, Break 3: $35 |
| Unit has 2 repairs | Break 1: $35, Break 2: $30, Break 3: $25 |

### Customer Approval

- If customer has **auto-approval** enabled: All breaks approved automatically
- Otherwise: Customer must approve entire batch (all-or-nothing)
- Customer sees: "3 breaks found on Unit 1001"

### Photo Flexibility

- **Photos are optional** at submission time
- You can submit repairs without photos and add them later
- **Common workflow 1** (Pre-approval):
  1. Document damage found (add breaks with damage types)
  2. Take before photos (damage documentation)
  3. Submit for customer approval (PENDING status)
  4. After approval, perform repairs
  5. Edit repairs to add after photos
  6. Mark as completed
- **Common workflow 2** (Auto-approve):
  1. Perform repairs immediately
  2. Take both before/after photos
  3. Submit complete batch
  4. Repairs auto-approved (APPROVED status)
- Mobile devices: Use camera directly
- HEIC photos from iPhone: Automatically converted to JPEG
- Recommended: Take photos in good lighting
- **Warning badges**: Orange badges on break cards remind you which photos are missing

### Data Safety

- **LocalStorage autosave**: Your work is saved as you go
- **If you accidentally close the browser**: On return, you'll be asked if you want to restore
- ⚠️ **Limitation**: Photos cannot be restored (browser security), you'll need to re-upload

### Transaction Safety

- All breaks submitted together as one transaction
- If any break fails, **none are created** (prevents partial batches)
- Database ensures data integrity

---

### Large Windshield with Multiple Damage

1. Inspect windshield, find 5 breaks
2. Photograph each damage point
3. Enter batch with all 5 breaks
4. System calculates: $50 + $40 + $35 + $30 + $25 = $180
5. Customer approves entire batch at once
6. Complete all repairs together

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing required information" error

**For Batch Submission (Multi-Break Entry)**:
- Ensure customer, unit number, and repair date are filled
- Ensure at least one break is added
- Each break must have damage type
- Photos are OPTIONAL at batch submission time (can be added later)

**When Editing Individual Repairs (After Batch Created)**:
- Photos uploaded during batch creation are automatically associated
- You can complete repairs without re-uploading photos
- Form will recognize existing photos from batch submission

### Pricing preview not showing

- Check that customer is selected
- Check that unit number is entered
- Wait a moment for AJAX request to complete

### Photos not uploading

- Check file size (max typically 10MB per photo)
- Ensure file format is supported (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)
- Check internet connection
- Try compressing image if too large

### Browser refresh lost my work

- Check for restore prompt on page load
- Note: Photos cannot be auto-restored (re-upload required)
- Tip: Submit batches promptly to avoid data loss

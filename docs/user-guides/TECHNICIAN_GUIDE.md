### Working Manager Capability

As a manager, you have **two options** for handling customer-requested repairs:

1. **Complete the repair yourself** - Accept and work on it like a regular technician
2. **Assign to a team member** - Delegate to someone on your team

This flexibility allows you to balance management duties with hands-on repair work.

### Option 1: Accepting Repairs for Yourself

**When viewing a REQUESTED repair**, you'll see:

```
[Accept Repair] [Assign to Technician]
```

**To complete it yourself**:
```
1. Dashboard shows "Customer Requested Repairs"
2. Click on REQUESTED repair
3. Click "Accept Repair" button
4. Repair assigns to you, status → APPROVED
5. Page refreshes showing "Start Repair" button
6. Click "Start Repair" → Status: IN_PROGRESS
7. Complete work as normal
8. Click "Mark as Completed" → Status: COMPLETED
```

**Result**:
- Repair assigned to YOU
- Status: APPROVED → ready to start

```
1. Dashboard shows "Customer Requested Repairs"
2. Click on REQUESTED repair
3. Click "Assign to Technician"
4. Select technician from dropdown (includes yourself)
5. Submit assignment
```

**What Happens**:

### Reassigning Team Repairs to Yourself

**If you need to take over a team member's repair**:

```
1. View repair assigned to team member
2. Click "Reassign to Me" button
3. Confirm reassignment
4. Repair now assigned to you
5. Original technician receives notification
6. You can now complete the repair
```

**Use Cases**:

### Pricing Override

*Available if you have override permission*

```
1. Create or edit repair
2. Scroll to "Manager Pricing Override"

```

**Limits**:

**Likely Cause**: Repair is PENDING customer approval

**Solution**:

### "Override section not showing"

**Check**:
- Are you a manager? ✓
- Do you have override permission? ✓
- Are you in /tech/ portal (not /admin/)? ✓

**Solution**: Contact admin to grant manager permissions

### "Assignment list is empty"

**Possible Reasons**:
- No customers have submitted requests
- Requests already assigned by other managers
- You're not designated as a manager

**Solution**: Check with team lead or admin

### "Can't update repair status"

**Check**:
- Is repair assigned to you? ✓
- Are you following proper status flow? ✓
- Is form showing validation errors? ✓

**Solution**: Review error messages, contact support if persists

```
1. Click "Add customer pricing"
2. Customer & Settings:
   - Customer: [Select from dropdown]
   ☑ Use custom pricing
   - Notes: "VIP customer - 10% discount on all repairs"

   - Repair 4 price: 27.00    (Leave blank for default $30)
   - Repair 5+ price: 22.50   (Leave blank for default $25)

4. Volume Discounts:
   - Threshold: 10            (Number of repairs to qualify)
   - Percentage: 15.00        (Discount percentage, e.g., 15%)

5. Save
```

### Common Pricing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Flat Discount (10% off everything)
```
Customer: ABC Logistics
Use custom pricing: ✓
Repair 1: 45.00   (10% off $50)
Repair 2: 36.00   (10% off $40)
Repair 3: 31.50   (10% off $35)
Repair 4: 27.00   (10% off $30)
Repair 5+: 22.50  (10% off $25)
```

#### Scenario 2: Volume Discount Only
```
Customer: City Delivery Co
Use custom pricing: ✓
(Leave all repair prices blank - uses defaults)
Volume threshold: 15
Volume percentage: 20.00
```

#### Scenario 3: Contract Pricing + Volume Bonus
```
Customer: Enterprise Fleet
Use custom pricing: ✓
Repair 1: 40.00
Repair 2: 40.00   (Same rate for first 2)
(Leave 3-5 blank - defaults apply)
Volume threshold: 25
Volume percentage: 15.00
```

### How Pricing Works

**Calculation Order**:
1. Check if custom pricing enabled
2. Get tier price (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th+ repair)
3. If tier price blank, use default
4. If volume discount qualified, apply percentage
5. If manager override present, use override

**Example**:
```
Customer: ABC Logistics (custom pricing + volume)
Unit: #45 (3rd repair for this unit)
Total customer repairs: 12 (exceeds threshold of 10)

Calculation:
- Base price (3rd repair): $31.50 (custom tier)
- Volume discount: 15%
- Final price: $31.50 × 0.85 = $26.78
```

2. **REQUIRE_APPROVAL**: Customer must approve every field repair
   - Use for: Cost-conscious customers, strict budget control
   - Result: Customer sees PENDING repairs on dashboard

3. **UNIT_THRESHOLD**: Auto-approve up to X units per visit
   - Use for: Flexible control, predictable costs
   - Result: First X units auto-approved, rest require approval

### Creating Preference

```
1. Click "Add customer repair preference"
2. Select customer
3. Choose approval mode:

## Storage Management

### Auditing Repair Photos in S3

**Purpose**: Identifies and removes orphaned photo files that remain in S3 storage after repairs are deleted.

**When to Use**:
- Monthly maintenance to identify storage waste
- After bulk repair deletions
- When investigating unexpected storage costs
- During system audits

**Command**:
```bash
# Audit only (dry run - safe to run anytime)
python manage.py audit_repair_photos

# Delete orphaned files (use with caution)
python manage.py audit_repair_photos --delete
```

### How It Works

The command:
1. Connects to your S3 bucket (`AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`)
2. Lists all files in `media/repair_photos/` directory
3. Compares S3 files against database photo references
4. Identifies:
   - **Orphaned files**: In S3 but not referenced in database (should be deleted)
   - **Missing files**: Referenced in database but not in S3 (indicates a problem)

### Example Output

**Audit Run (Dry Run)**:
```
Starting repair photo audit...
Fetching files from S3...
Found 14 files in S3

Fetching photo references from database...
Found 8 photo references in database

================================================================================
AUDIT RESULTS
================================================================================

Found 6 ORPHANED files (in S3 but not in database):
Total size: 12.45 MB
Estimated monthly cost: $0.0003

  - media/repair_photos/before/IMG_0433.jpeg (2.1 MB, modified: 2025-10-30 09:53:38)
  - media/repair_photos/after/IMG_0434.jpeg (2.3 MB, modified: 2025-10-30 09:53:38)
  - media/repair_photos/before/IMG_0436.jpeg (2.0 MB, modified: 2025-10-30 09:55:42)
  - media/repair_photos/after/IMG_0437.jpeg (1.9 MB, modified: 2025-10-30 09:55:43)
  - media/repair_photos/before/IMG_0439.jpeg (2.1 MB, modified: 2025-11-01 18:35:21)
  - media/repair_photos/after/IMG_0440.jpeg (2.0 MB, modified: 2025-11-01 18:35:21)

No missing files!

================================================================================
DRY RUN MODE: No files were deleted. Use --delete to actually remove orphaned files.
================================================================================

Audit complete!
```

**Delete Run**:
```bash
python manage.py audit_repair_photos --delete
```
```
Starting repair photo audit...
[... audit results ...]

================================================================================
DELETING ORPHANED FILES
================================================================================

Audit complete!
```

### Understanding the Results

**Orphaned Files**:
- Photos that remain after repairs are deleted
- Before November 2025: Photos were NOT automatically deleted
- After November 2025: `django-cleanup` automatically deletes photos
- Safe to delete orphaned files - they're no longer referenced

**Missing Files**:
- Database references photos that don't exist in S3
- Indicates:
  - Manual file deletion without updating database
  - S3 bucket misconfiguration
  - File upload failures
- **Action Required**: Investigate why files are missing

**Storage Costs**:
- S3 Standard Storage: ~$0.023 per GB per month
- Command calculates estimated monthly cost of orphaned files
- Small files have negligible cost, but accumulation matters

### Safety & Best Practices

**Before Deleting**:
1. ✅ Run audit without `--delete` first
2. ✅ Review the list of files to be deleted
3. ✅ Check modification dates (recent files need review)
4. ✅ Ensure you have database backups
5. ✅ Consider taking S3 snapshot if deleting many files

**When to Delete**:
- ✅ Files are older than 30 days
- ✅ Audit shows reasonable file count (<100 files)
- ✅ You've verified against recent repair deletions
- ✅ Storage costs justify cleanup effort

**When NOT to Delete**:
- ❌ Files modified in last 7 days (might be active uploads)
- ❌ Large number of files (>500) without investigation
- ❌ Missing files reported (indicates bigger problem)
- ❌ During active repair operations

### Task: Monthly Storage Audit

**Recommended Process**:
```bash
# 1. Run audit to identify orphaned files
python manage.py audit_repair_photos

# 2. Review output:
#    - Note total size and cost
#    - Check modification dates
#    - Look for patterns

# 3. If orphaned files > 50 MB or > 30 files:
#    - Document findings
#    - Get approval if needed
#    - Run deletion

# 4. Delete orphaned files
python manage.py audit_repair_photos --delete

# 5. Verify deletion
python manage.py audit_repair_photos

# 6. Document in maintenance log
```

### Automatic Photo Deletion (November 2025+)

**New Behavior**:
Since November 2025, the system automatically deletes photos when repairs are deleted using the `django-cleanup` package. The `audit_repair_photos` command is now primarily for:
- Cleaning up historical orphaned files (pre-November 2025)
- Periodic verification that automatic deletion is working
- Troubleshooting unexpected storage growth

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check if django-cleanup is installed
pip list | grep django-cleanup
# Should show: django-cleanup==9.0.0

# Check settings.py
grep -A 20 "INSTALLED_APPS" rs_systems/settings.py | grep django_cleanup
# Should show: 'django_cleanup.apps.CleanupConfig',
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Manager Can't See Override Section

**Check**:
1. User has technician profile ✓
2. Technician marked as manager ✓
3. "Can override pricing" checked ✓
4. User logging into /tech/ portal (not /admin/) ✓

### Issue: Custom Pricing Not Applying

**Check**:
1. CustomerPricing record exists ✓
2. "Use custom pricing" checked ✓
3. Tier prices set (blank = default) ✓
4. Test with shell command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell -c "
   from apps.technician_portal.services.pricing_service import calculate_repair_cost
   from core.models import Customer
   customer = Customer.objects.get(name='ABC Logistics')
   print(calculate_repair_cost(customer, 1))
   "
   ```

### Issue: Approval Preference Not Working

**Check**:
1. CustomerRepairPreference exists ✓
2. Correct approval mode selected ✓
3. Unit threshold set (if using UNIT_THRESHOLD mode) ✓
4. Test with new repair creation ✓

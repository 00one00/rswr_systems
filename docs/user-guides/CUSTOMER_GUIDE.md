## Lot Walking Service Settings

Configure scheduled lot walking service where technicians proactively inspect your fleet.

### What is Lot Walking?

Lot walking is a proactive inspection service where technicians visit your location on a regular schedule to:
- Inspect all vehicles for windshield damage
- Identify issues before they become urgent
- Repair damage immediately (subject to your approval settings)
- Provide inspection reports

**Benefits**:
- Catch small chips before they crack
- Reduce emergency repairs
- Keep fleet windshields in compliance
- Preventive maintenance approach

### Configuring Lot Walking Preferences

**Access Settings**:
```
1. Go to Account Settings
2. Click "Repair Preferences" tab
3. Scroll to "Lot Walking Schedule" section
```

**Enable Service**:
```
☑ Enable Lot Walking Service
```
Check this box to enable scheduled lot walking for your fleet.

**Set Frequency**:
Choose how often you want technicians to inspect your lot:
- **Weekly**: Every week (best for large fleets or high-damage environments)
- **Bi-weekly**: Every 2 weeks (balanced approach)
- **Monthly**: Once per month (smaller fleets)
- **Quarterly**: Every 3 months (seasonal inspections)

**Choose Preferred Days**:
Select which days work best for your operation:
```
☑ Monday
☑ Wednesday
☑ Friday
```
You can select multiple days. The system will use these preferences when scheduling.

**Set Preferred Time**:
```
Preferred Time: [09:00 AM]
```
Choose the time that works best for your operation (e.g., early morning before fleet goes out).

### How It Works

**Configuration Process**:
```
1. You enable lot walking and set preferences
2. Save your settings
3. Your preferences are stored in the system
4. Contact support to coordinate initial lot walk schedule
5. Technician performs lot walk on agreed schedule
6. Repairs handled per your approval settings
7. You receive summary report
```

**Current Implementation Status**:
> ⚠️ **Note**: The automatic scheduling system is in development. Your preferences are saved, but you'll need to contact support to arrange lot walks based on your saved settings. The automated scheduler that uses these preferences will be implemented in a future release.

### Lot Walking + Approval Settings

Lot walking works together with your field repair approval mode:

**If You Have "Auto-Approve All"**:
```
Technician walks your lot
    ↓
Finds damage on 5 units
    ↓
Creates repairs (auto-approved)
    ↓
Completes all 5 repairs immediately
    ↓
You get summary: "5 repairs completed during lot walk"
```

**If You Have "Require Approval"**:
```
Technician walks your lot
    ↓
Finds damage on 5 units
    ↓
Creates repair requests (PENDING)
    ↓
You see yellow alerts on dashboard
    ↓
You review and approve each one
    ↓
Technician completes approved repairs
```

**If You Have "Unit Threshold" (e.g., 3 units)**:
```
Technician walks your lot
    ↓
Finds damage on 5 units
    ↓
First 3 units: Auto-approved & repaired
Next 2 units: Require your approval
    ↓
You approve the additional 2 units
    ↓
Technician completes all repairs
```

### Example Configurations

**Large Fleet (100+ vehicles)**:
```
Enable Lot Walking: ☑ Yes
Frequency: Weekly
Days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
Time: 6:00 AM (before fleet departs)
Approval Mode: Unit Threshold (10 units)

Result: Tech inspects lot 3x/week at 6 AM,
        auto-approves first 10 units,
        you approve any additional
```

**Small Fleet (20-30 vehicles)**:
```
Enable Lot Walking: ☑ Yes
Frequency: Monthly
Days: First Monday of month
Time: 9:00 AM
Approval Mode: Auto-Approve All

Result: Tech inspects once per month,
        fixes everything found,
        you get monthly report
```

**Budget-Conscious Operation**:
```
Enable Lot Walking: ☑ Yes
Frequency: Quarterly
Days: Tuesday
Time: 10:00 AM
Approval Mode: Require Approval

Result: Tech inspects every 3 months,
        you review and approve each repair,
        tight cost control
```

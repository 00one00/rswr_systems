## Quick Testing Setup

### Prerequisites
- Functioning Django environment (see main README.md)
- Database access (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)
- Valid user accounts or ability to create test data

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Ensure database is set up
python manage.py setup_db
python manage.py setup_groups

# Create test data (recommended for testing)
python manage.py create_test_data --clean
```

## Automated Testing

### Django Unit Tests

The system includes Django's built-in testing framework for component testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Test specific apps
python manage.py test apps.technician_portal
python manage.py test apps.customer_portal
python manage.py test apps.rewards_referrals

# Test with verbose output
python manage.py test --verbosity=2

# Test specific test cases
python manage.py test apps.technician_portal.tests.RepairTestCase
```

### System Flow Testing

A comprehensive automated test validates the complete repair request flow:

```bash
# Run the automated system flow test
python manage.py test_system_flow --verbose

# Run with cleanup of test data
python manage.py test_system_flow --cleanup
```

**What the System Flow Test Covers:**
- Customer repair request creation
- Technician assignment with load balancing
- Multi-technician visibility validation
- Portal separation and authentication
- Complete repair status progression (REQUESTED â†’ COMPLETED)
- Cost calculation verification
- Reward application testing

### Expected Test Results

**Successful Test Output:**
```
=== Testing Repair Request Flow ===
âœ… Customer login successful
âœ… Repair request submitted successfully
âœ… Repair created in database with ID [number]
âœ… Repair assigned to technician: [username]
âœ… Repair should be visible to technician [tech1]
âœ… Repair should be visible to technician [tech2]
âœ… Status updated to APPROVED
âœ… Status updated to IN_PROGRESS
âœ… Status updated to COMPLETED
âœ… Final cost calculated: $50.00

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! The repair flow is working correctly.
```

## Manual Testing Workflows

### Complete End-to-End Testing

This workflow tests the entire system from customer request through completion:

#### Step 1: Customer Portal Testing

1. **Login as Customer**
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000/app/login/`
   - Username: `democustomer`
   - Password: `demo123`

2. **Submit Repair Request**
   - Navigate to "Request Repair"
   - Fill out form:
     - Unit Number: `TEST001`
     - Description: `Front windshield crack repair`
     - Damage Type: `Crack`
   - Submit request
   - **Expected Result**: Success message and redirect to dashboard

3. **Verify Request in Dashboard**
   - Check that repair appears in "Recent Repairs"
   - Status should be "Customer Requested"
   - Note the repair ID for tracking

#### Step 2: Technician Portal Testing

1. **Login as Technician**
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000/tech/login/`
   - Username: `tech1`, `tech2`, or `tech3`
   - Password: `demo123`

2. **Verify Repair Visibility**
   - Check dashboard for "Customer Requested Repairs" section
   - **Expected Result**: The repair from Step 1 should be visible
   - **Important**: ALL technicians should see the repair (this validates the fix)

3. **Accept and Progress Repair**
   - Click on the repair to view details
   - Update status to "Approved"
   - **Expected Result**: Customer notification, status change logged
   - Progress through: `Approved` â†’ `In Progress` â†’ `Completed`

4. **Verify Cost Calculation**
   - When marked "Completed", cost should be automatically calculated
   - **Expected Result**: $50.00 for first repair of this unit

#### Step 3: Multi-Technician Testing

1. **Test Load Balancing**
   - Create multiple repair requests as customer
   - Check that repairs are distributed among available technicians
   - **Expected Result**: Repairs assigned to technicians with least current workload

2. **Test Visibility Across Technicians**
   - Login as different technicians
   - **Expected Result**: All REQUESTED repairs visible to all technicians

### Portal Separation Testing

#### Customer Portal Access Control
```bash
# Test customer portal URLs
http://localhost:8000/app/           # Should redirect to login if not authenticated
http://localhost:8000/app/login/     # Customer login page
http://localhost:8000/app/register/  # Customer registration
```

#### Technician Portal Access Control
```bash
# Test technician portal URLs
http://localhost:8000/tech/          # Should redirect to login if not authenticated
http://localhost:8000/tech/login/    # Technician login page
```

#### Cross-Portal Security
1. **Login as Customer**
2. **Attempt to Access Technician Portal**
   - Try: `http://localhost:8000/tech/`
   - **Expected Result**: Redirect or access denied

3. **Login as Technician**
4. **Attempt to Access Customer Portal**
   - Try: `http://localhost:8000/app/`
   - **Expected Result**: Redirect or access denied

## Test Data Management

### Creating Test Data

The system provides a management command for creating consistent test data:

```bash
# Create fresh test data
python manage.py create_test_data --clean

# Create test data without cleaning existing data
python manage.py create_test_data
```

**Test Accounts Created:**
- **Customer**: `democustomer` / `demo123`
- **Technicians**: `tech1`, `tech2`, `tech3` / `demo123`
- **Admin**: `demoadmin` / `demo123`

### Cleaning Test Data

```bash
# Clean only test data (preserves real data)
python manage.py create_test_data --clean
```

### Manual Test Data Setup

If you need to create test data manually:

1. **Create Customer Company**
   ```python
   # In Django shell (python manage.py shell)
   from core.models import Customer
   customer = Customer.objects.create(
       name='test company',
       email='test@company.com',
       phone='555-0123'
   )
   ```

2. **Create Customer User**
   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.models import User
   from apps.customer_portal.models import CustomerUser
   
   user = User.objects.create_user(
       username='testcustomer',
       email='customer@test.com',
       password='testpass'
   )
   
   CustomerUser.objects.create(
       user=user,
       customer=customer,
       is_primary_contact=True
   )
   ```

## Regression Testing

### Critical Features to Test After Changes

1. **Repair Assignment Logic**
   - Customer creates repair â†’ Assigned to technician with least load
   - Multiple repairs â†’ Distributed evenly among technicians

2. **Repair Visibility**
   - All REQUESTED repairs visible to all technicians
   - Technicians can only modify their assigned repairs (non-admin)
   - Admins can see and modify all repairs

3. **Status Progression**
   - Customer request â†’ Technician approval â†’ Work completion
   - Automatic cost calculation on completion
   - Reward application when applicable

4. **Portal Separation**
   - Customers cannot access technician features
   - Technicians cannot access customer-only features
   - Proper authentication and authorization

### Automated Regression Testing

```bash
# Full regression test suite
python manage.py test --verbosity=2

# Quick smoke test
python manage.py test_system_flow --verbose --cleanup
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios

1. **Multiple Simultaneous Repair Requests**
   - Create 10+ repair requests simultaneously
   - Verify load balancing works correctly
   - Check response times remain acceptable

2. **Database Query Performance**
   ```python
   # Test repair lookup performance
   from apps.technician_portal.models import Repair
   from django.test.utils import override_settings
   
   # Create 1000+ repairs and test query times
   repairs = Repair.objects.filter(queue_status='REQUESTED')
   # Should complete in <100ms for reasonable data sets
   ```

3. **Dashboard Loading**
   - Time technician dashboard loading with various data volumes
   - Customer dashboard performance with multiple repairs

## Security Testing

### Authentication Testing

1. **Password Security**
   - Test password requirements
   - Verify failed login handling
   - Test session timeout

2. **Authorization Testing**
   - Verify role-based access controls
   - Test that users cannot access unauthorized data
   - Confirm API endpoint security

3. **Data Protection**
   - Test that customer data is isolated
   - Verify technicians cannot see other technicians' assigned repairs
   - Confirm sensitive data is not exposed in API responses

### Security Test Commands

```bash
# Test with different user permissions
python manage.py test apps.security

# Verify API authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Token your-token" http://localhost:8000/api/repairs/
```

## Testing Environments

```

## Test Automation and CI/CD

### GitHub Actions (Example)

```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Setup database
        run: python manage.py setup_db
      - name: Run tests
        run: python manage.py test --verbosity=2
      - name: Run system flow test
        run: python manage.py test_system_flow --cleanup
```

## Troubleshooting Test Issues

### Common Test Failures

1. **"No technicians available"**
   - **Cause**: No technician accounts in database
   - **Solution**: Run `python manage.py create_test_data`

2. **"Repair not visible to technician"**
   - **Cause**: Dashboard not showing REQUESTED repairs correctly
   - **Solution**: Check technician assignment logic in `technician_portal/views.py:88-96`

3. **"Database connection error"**
   - **Cause**: Database not set up or incorrect configuration
   - **Solution**: Run `python manage.py setup_db` and check `CLAUDE.md` for configuration

4. **"Authentication failed"**
   - **Cause**: Test user accounts don't exist or wrong credentials
   - **Solution**: Verify test data creation or check password

### Test Environment Issues

1. **Port conflicts (development server)**
   ```bash
   # Kill processes on port 8000
   lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill
   # Start server on different port
   python manage.py runserver 8001
   ```

2. **Database migration issues**
   ```bash
   # Reset migrations if needed (development only!)
   python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Static file issues**
   ```bash
   # Collect static files
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

## Deployment Phase

### Pre-Deployment Backup
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create immediate database backup
  ```bash
  eb ssh
  pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME > pre_deployment_backup.sql
  aws s3 cp pre_deployment_backup.sql s3://rs-systems-backups-20250823/emergency/
  ```
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Backup current media files
  ```bash
  aws s3 sync /var/app/current/media/ s3://rs-systems-backups-20250823/emergency/media/
  ```
- [ ] Download backups to local machine (extra safety)
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Create deployment git tag
  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.X.X -m "Production deployment - Sprint X"
  git push origin v1.X.X
  ```
- [ ] Deploy application
  ```bash
  eb deploy rs-systems-prod
  ```
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs
  ```bash
  eb logs --stream
  ```
- [ ] Wait for deployment completion (no errors)

### Database Migration
- [ ] SSH into production
  ```bash
  eb ssh rs-systems-prod
  ```
- [ ] Activate virtual environment
  ```bash
  cd /var/app/current
  source /var/app/venv/*/bin/activate
  ```
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create pre-migration backup
  ```bash
  python manage.py dumpdata > pre_migration_data.json
  ```
- [ ] Run migrations
  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
- [ ] Verify migration success (no errors)
- [ ] Check migration status
  ```bash
  python manage.py showmigrations
  ```

### Application Restart
- [ ] Restart application servers
  ```bash
  eb restart rs-systems-prod
  ```
- [ ] Wait for health check to pass
- [ ] Verify application status
  ```bash
  eb health
  ```

---

## Rollback Procedure

### When to Rollback
Rollback if any of these occur:
- Critical functionality broken
- Data corruption detected
- Security vulnerability introduced
- Performance degradation >50%
- Database migration failure
- Unable to login (any portal)

### Rollback Steps

#### 1. Immediate Actions
```bash
# Stop accepting new requests (if applicable)
eb setenv MAINTENANCE_MODE=true
```

#### 2. Code Rollback
```bash
# Redeploy previous version
git checkout <previous-commit-or-tag>
eb deploy

# Or restore from previous EB version
eb deploy --version <previous-version-label>
```

#### 3. Database Rollback
```bash
# SSH into production
eb ssh

# Restore pre-deployment backup
aws s3 cp s3://rs-systems-backups-20250823/emergency/pre_deployment_backup.sql ./
psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME < pre_deployment_backup.sql

# Or rollback migrations
python manage.py migrate <app_name> <previous_migration_number>
```

#### 4. Media Files Rollback
```bash
# Restore media files if needed
aws s3 sync s3://rs-systems-backups-20250823/emergency/media/ /var/app/current/media/
```

#### 5. Verification
```bash
# Restart application
eb restart

# Verify health
eb health

# Test critical functionality
curl https://rockstarwindshield.repair/health
```

#### 6. Communication
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of rollback
- [ ] Document reason for rollback
- [ ] Create incident report
- [ ] Plan fix and re-deployment

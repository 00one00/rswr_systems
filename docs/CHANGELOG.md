## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-02

### ðŸ”§ Fixed - Critical Repair Flow Issue

#### Issue Resolution: Repair Visibility and Assignment

**Problem**: Repairs requested through the customer portal were not appearing in the technician portal dashboard, causing workflow disruption and missed repair requests.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Technician dashboard filtered repairs to show only those assigned to the specific logged-in technician
- Customer repair requests were assigned using `technicians.first()`, often assigning to a different technician than the one logged in
- This created a disconnect where repairs existed but weren't visible to available technicians

**Solution Implemented**:

#### Enhanced Technician Assignment Logic
- **File**: `apps/customer_portal/views.py:500-514`
- **Change**: Replaced basic `technicians.first()` with intelligent load-balancing algorithm
- **Algorithm**: Assigns repairs to technician with least active workload using database aggregation
- **Query**: 
  ```python
  technicians = Technician.objects.annotate(
      active_repairs=Count('repair', filter=Q(repair__queue_status__in=[
          'REQUESTED', 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'IN_PROGRESS'
      ]))
  ).order_by('active_repairs', 'id')
  ```

#### Improved Dashboard Visibility
- **File**: `apps/technician_portal/views.py:88-96`
- **Change**: Updated technician dashboard to show ALL `REQUESTED` repairs to all technicians
- **Previous Behavior**: Only repairs assigned to specific technician were visible
- **New Behavior**: All REQUESTED repairs visible with assignment indicators
- **Enhancement**: Added `assigned_to_me` flag to distinguish personal assignments

#### Benefits
1. **Fair Workload Distribution**: Repairs automatically assigned to technicians with least active work
2. **Improved Visibility**: All technicians can see available work, preventing missed requests
3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Technicians can see system-wide repair queue status
4. **Better Resource Utilization**: Prevents bottlenecks when specific technicians are unavailable

### ðŸ§ª Added - Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

#### Management Commands
- **`create_test_data`**: Creates consistent test data with demo accounts
  - Customer account: `democustomer` / `demo123`
  - Technician accounts: `tech1`, `tech2`, `tech3` / `demo123`
  - Admin account: `demoadmin` / `demo123`
  - Automated cleanup functionality with `--clean` flag

- **`test_system_flow`**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing suite
  - Tests complete repair request flow from customer to completion
  - Validates technician assignment and load balancing
  - Verifies multi-technician visibility
  - Tests portal separation and authentication
  - Validates repair status progression and cost calculation

#### Test Coverage
- **Customer Portal**: Repair request creation and submission
- **Technician Portal**: Repair visibility and status management  
- **Assignment Logic**: Load balancing verification
- **Authentication**: Portal separation and access control
- **Business Logic**: Cost calculation and reward application

#### Automated Verification

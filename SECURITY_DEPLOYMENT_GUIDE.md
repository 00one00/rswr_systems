# Security Deployment Guide

## Current Status
The site should now load properly with temporarily disabled security settings.

## Security Settings Temporarily Disabled
1. HTTPS enforcement (`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`)
2. Secure cookies (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`)
3. Content Security Policy middleware

## Gradual Re-enablement Process

### Step 1: Test Current State
1. Verify the site loads and functions properly
2. Test all major functionality (login, dashboard, forms)
3. Check browser console for any errors

### Step 2: Re-enable Security Settings Gradually

#### Phase 1: Enable Secure Cookies (if HTTPS is working)
```python
# In settings_aws.py, uncomment:
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

#### Phase 2: Enable HTTPS Redirect (if load balancer supports it)
```python
# In settings_aws.py, uncomment:
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
```

#### Phase 3: Re-enable CSP Headers
```python
# In settings_aws.py, uncomment:
if not DEBUG:
    MIDDLEWARE.insert(1, 'apps.security.middleware.SecurityHeadersMiddleware')
```

### Step 3: Monitor and Adjust

#### If CSP Issues Occur:
Modify `apps/security/middleware.py` to be more permissive:

```python
# More permissive CSP for troubleshooting
csp_directives = [
    "default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'",
    "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https:",
    "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https:",
    "font-src 'self' https: data:",
    "img-src 'self' data: https:",
    "connect-src 'self' https:",
]
```

#### If HTTPS Issues Occur:
Check AWS load balancer configuration and ensure:
1. SSL certificate is properly configured
2. Load balancer forwards X-Forwarded-Proto header
3. Health checks are configured for HTTP or HTTPS appropriately

## Current Security Status
- ✅ Hardcoded credentials removed
- ✅ Wildcard ALLOWED_HOSTS removed  
- ✅ Input validation enhanced
- ✅ XSS prevention implemented
- ⏸️ HTTPS enforcement (temporarily disabled)
- ⏸️ CSP headers (temporarily disabled)

## Next Steps
1. Test the site functionality
2. Gradually re-enable security settings
3. Monitor for any issues
4. Adjust CSP policy as needed for your specific requirements
